I think overall the code is good. i also don't know yet how this system flows or work. so i can't really say comment about the process and edit how it works.
but looking at how the code is structured it seems good cause i can read it without the comments, formatting is also okay.
But some recommendation for implementing the Validations.
in the code i replace the required field validation to use the Validator by laravel.
i think its necessary cause the validation errors should be returned all at once.(it can also benefit the front end part by making it more user friendly and reduce the number of requests.)
so when a user fill datas on a input eg. due_date.
and the user click save without filling the other fields.
it will only return a specific validation error.
i recommend using the built in validator of laravel.
but since the response json is already set, there should be an adjustment also in the front end part of the code.

on the code that i modified in the validation, the proper json response for the validation error will be automatically generated by the validator.
the advantage is the validator results automatically generated and can also check its other aspects like the min value, max value, if its a number etc etc. this is all available on the docs. https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/validation

thank you.
